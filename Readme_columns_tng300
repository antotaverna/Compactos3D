['SubhaloCM']:(X,Y,Z) Comoving center of mass of the Subhalo, computed as the sum of the mass weighted relative coordinates of all particles/cells in the Subhalo, of all types.(ckpc/h)
4* ['SubhaloHalfmassRad']:Comoving radius containing half of the total mass (SubhaloMass) of this Subhalo.(ckpc/h)
5* ['SubhaloMass']:Total mass of all member particle/cells which are bound to this Subhalo, of all types. Particle/cells bound to subhaloes of this Subhalo are NOT accounted for.(10^10 M⊙ /h)
6* ['SubhaloStellarPhotometricsMassInRad']:Sum of the mass of the member stellar particles, but restricted to stars within the radius SubhaloStellarPhotometricsRad.(10^10 M⊙ /h)
7* ['SubhaloStellarPhotometricsRad']:Radius at which the surface brightness profile (computed from all member stellar particles) drops below the limit of 20.7 mag arcsec^−2 in the K band (in comoving units). (ckpc/h)
8* ['SubhaloParent']:Index back into this same Subhalo table of the unique Subfind host/parent of this Subhalo. This index is local to the group (i.e. 2 indicates the third most massive subhalo of the parent halo of this subhalo, not the third most massive of the whole snapshot). The values are often zero for all subhalos of a group, indicating that there is no resolved hierarchical structure in that group, beyond the primary subhalo having as direct children all of the secondary subhalos.

10* ['SubhaloPos']: X- Spatial position within the periodic box (of the particle with the minium gravitational potential energy). Comoving coordinate. (ckpc/h)

12* ['SubhaloPos']: Z- Spatial position within the periodic box (of the particle with the minium gravitational potential energy). Comoving coordinate. (ckpc/h)
13* ['SubhaloSFR']: Sum of the individual star formation rates of all gas cells in this subhalo. (M⊙ /yr)
14* ['SubhaloVelDisp']: One-dimensional velocity dispersion of all the member particles/cells (the 3D dispersion divided by 3–√3). (km/s)
15* ['SubhaloVel']: X-Peculiar velocity of the group, computed as the sum of the mass weighted velocities of all particles/cells in this group, of all types. No unit conversion is needed. (km/s)

26* halos['GroupFirstSub']: Index into the Subhalo table of the first/primary/most massive Subfind group within this FoF group. Note: This value is signed (or should be interpreted as signed)! In this case, a value of -1 indicates that this FoF group has no subhalos.
