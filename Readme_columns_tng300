#Descripcion propiedades de Illustris TNG300-1 z=0
#--------------------------
#  SubHalos
#--------------------------
['SubhaloCM']:(X,Y,Z) Comoving center of mass of the Subhalo.(ckpc/h)
['SubhaloPos']: (X,Y,Z) Spatial position within the periodic box. Comoving coordinate. (ckpc/h)
['SubhaloVel']: (VX,VY,VZ)-Peculiar velocity of the group. No unit conversion is needed. (km/s)
['SubhaloVelDisp']: One-dimensional velocity dispersion of all the member particles/cells (the 3D dispersion divided by 3–√3). (km/s)
particles/cells in this group, of all types. No unit conversion is needed. (km/s)
['SubhaloSFR']: Sum of the individual star formation rates of all gas cells in this subhalo. (M⊙ /yr)
['SubhaloStellarPhotometrics'] band: U,B,V,K,g,r,i,z.
        Magnitudes based on the summed-up luminosities of all the stellar particles of the group.
['SubhaloMass']: Total mass of all member particle/cells which are bound to this Subhalo, of all types.
        Particle/cells bound to subhaloes of this Subhalo are NOT accounted for.(10^10 M⊙ /h)
['SubhaloHalfmassRadType']:(N,6) Comoving radius containing half of the mass of this Subhalo split by Type (SubhaloMassType).(ckpc/h)

['SubhaloStellarPhotometricsMassInRad']: Sum of the mass of the member stellar particles,
        but restricted to stars within the radius SubhaloStellarPhotometricsRad.(10^10 M⊙ /h)
['SubhaloMassInRadType']: (N,6) Sum of masses of all particles/cells (split by type)
        within twice the stellar half mass radius. (1010M⊙/h)

['SubhaloGrNr']: Index into the Group table of the FOF host/parent of this Subhalo.

#--------------------------
#  Halos
#--------------------------
halos['GroupFirstSub']: Index into the Subhalo table of the first/primary/most massive Subfind group within this FoF group.
          Note: This value is signed (or should be interpreted as signed)! In this case, a value of -1 indicates that this FoF group has no subhalos.
halos['GroupNsubs']: Count of the total number of Subfind groups within this FoF group.

halos['GroupPos']: (X,Y,Z)-Spatial position within the periodic box. Comoving coordinate. (ckpc/h)
halos['GroupVel']: (VX,Vy,VZ)-Velocity of the group. The peculiar velocity is obtained by multiplying this value by 1/a. (km/s/a)

halos['Group_M_Crit200']: Total Mass of this group enclosed in a sphere
        whose mean density is 200 times the critical density of the Universe, at the time the halo is considered. (10^10 M⊙ /h)
halos['Group_M_Mean200']: Total Mass of this group enclosed in a sphere
        whose mean density is 200 times the mean density of the Universe, at the time the halo is considered. (10^10 M⊙ /h)
halos['Group_R_Crit200']: Comoving Radius of a sphere centered at the GroupPos of this Group
        whose mean density is 200 times the critical density of the Universe, at the time the halo is considered. (ckpc/h)
halos['Group_R_Mean200']: Comoving Radius of a sphere centered at the GroupPos of this Group
        whose mean density is 200 times the mean density of the Universe, at the time the halo is considered. (ckpc/h)
halos['GroupCM']: (X,Y,Z)-Center of mass of the group. Comoving coordinate. (Available only for the Illustris-3 run) (ckpc/h)
